# Auction Close & Watchlist Removal Feature

## Summary
This document outlines the changes made to enable sellers to close auctions, view closed auctions in their profile, and remove the watchlist feature from the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Close Auction API Function
**File:** `src/lib/auctionApi.js`

Added new `closeAuction` function to the API service:
```javascript
closeAuction: async (auctionId, winnerId = null) => {
  const response = await apiRequest(`/Auctions/${auctionId}/close`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ winnerId }),
  });
  return response.data || response;
}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/Auctions/{auctionId}/close`

### 2. Dashboard Updates
**File:** `src/app/Dashboard/page.jsx`

#### A. Added Close Auction Handler
Created `handleCloseAuction` function that:
- Checks if auction has bids
- Shows appropriate confirmation dialog based on bid count
- Calls the `closeAuction` API endpoint
- Updates local state to mark auction as "Closed"
- Shows success message with winner notification (if bids exist)
- Refreshes dashboard data

#### B. Added Close Button to Auction Cards
- Button only appears for **Active** auctions
- Green color scheme (bg-green-50, text-green-600)
- Check circle icon
- Tooltip: "Close this auction and confirm winner"
- Located in auction card action buttons

#### C. Removed Watchlist Feature
Completely removed watchlist functionality:
- ✅ Removed watchlist tab from navigation
- ✅ Removed watchlist stats card (changed grid from 4 to 3 columns)
- ✅ Removed watchlist tab content section
- ✅ Removed watchlist section from overview tab
- ✅ Removed watchlist card from profile activity summary
- ⚠️ **Note:** Kept `watchlist` state variable for now to avoid breaking existing code

#### D. Added Closed Auctions to Profile Tab
New section in profile showing:
- List of all closed auctions by the user
- Auction image, title, final price
- Total bid count
- Close date
- "Closed" status badge
- "View Details" button
- Empty state message when no closed auctions exist

Updated Activity Summary Cards:
- Replaced "Watchlist Items" card with "Closed Auctions" card
- Shows count of auctions with status === 'Closed'
- Gray color scheme to match closed status

## User Flow

### Closing an Auction
1. User navigates to Dashboard → My Auctions tab
2. Finds an **Active** auction they want to close
3. Clicks the green "Close" button
4. Confirmation dialog appears:
   - **With bids:** Shows bid count and current highest bid
   - **Without bids:** Shows message that no bids were placed
5. User confirms the action
6. System calls backend API to close auction
7. Success message appears
8. Dashboard refreshes to show updated status

### Viewing Closed Auctions
1. User navigates to Dashboard → Profile tab
2. Scrolls to "Closed Auctions" section
3. Sees all their closed auctions with:
   - Final sale price
   - Total number of bids
   - Close date
   - Visual status indicator
4. Can click "View Details" to see full auction page

## Button Colors in Dashboard
- **Blue:** View auction details
- **Green:** Close auction (Active auctions only)
- **Red:** Delete auction

## Technical Details

### Close Auction Logic
```javascript
// Check bid count
const bidCount = calculateBidCount(auction);

// Different confirmation messages
if (bidCount > 0) {
  // Show message with bid count and current price
  // Winner will be notified automatically
} else {
  // Show message that auction had no bids
}

// API call
await auctionAPI.closeAuction(auction.id);

// Update state
setUserAuctions(prev => 
  prev.map(a => 
    a.id === auction.id 
      ? { ...a, status: 'Closed' } 
      : a
  )
);
```

### Backend Requirements
The backend must have implemented:
- `POST /api/Auctions/{id}/close` endpoint
- Winner determination logic (highest bidder)
- Winner notification system
- Auction status update to "Closed"
